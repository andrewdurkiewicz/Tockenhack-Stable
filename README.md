# SeedScholar

To access the bot open the Token app and either scan the QR code provided in the repository or search for @SeedScholarBot in your token favorites. Once connected, you can interact with the bot to browse fields of study and find a suitable candidate you would like to sponsor. Once you find a candidate, you will be brought to a webview of our DApp where you can establish your connection by "seeding" the student on the smart contract. The student will have a utility page in which they can prompt the smart contract to withdraw any of their outstanding funds periodically as they are released on action by grade reports from the school. Our ambition is to lower the barriers of entry for donors and students alike to better match students to sponsors and donors to fund the field of study of their choice.<br><br>

The current state of the application is a work in progress and proof of concept. We are working toward developing a professional and useful platform.
